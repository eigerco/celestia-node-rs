/// The data matrix in Celestia blocks extended with parity data.
///
/// It is created by a fixed size chunks of data, called [`Share`]s.
/// Each share is a cell of the [`ExtendedDataSquare`].
///
/// # Structure
///
/// The [`ExtendedDataSquare`] consists of four quadrants. The first
/// quadrant (upper-left) is the original data submitted to the network,
/// referred to as `OriginalDataSquare`. The other three quadrants are
/// the parity data encoded row-wise or column-wise using Reed-Solomon
/// `codec` specified in `EDS`.
///
/// The below diagram shows how the `EDS` is constructed. First, the 2nd
/// and 3rd quadrants are created by computing Reed-Solomon parity data
/// of the original data square, row-wise for 2nd and column-wise for
/// 3rd quadrant. Then, the 4th quadrant is computed either row-wise
/// from 3rd or column-wise from 2nd quadrant.

/// # Data availability
///
/// The [`DataAvailabilityHeader`] is created by computing [`Nmt`] merkle
/// roots of each row and column of [`ExtendedDataSquare`].
/// By putting those together there are some key
/// properties those have in terms of data availability.
///
/// Thanks to the parity data, to make original data unrecoverable, a malicious
/// actor would need to hide more than a half of the data from each row and column.
/// If we take `k` as the width of the `OriginalDataSquare`, then the attacker
/// needs to hide more than `(k + 1)^2` shares from the [`ExtendedDataSquare`].
/// For the `EDS` with a width of 4, the attacker needs to hide more than 50% of
/// all the shares and that value approaches 25% as the square grows.
///
/// This allows for really efficient data sampling, as the sampling node can reach
/// very high confidence that whole data is available by taking only a few samples.
///
/// # Example
///
/// This example shows rebuilding the merkle trees for each row of the EDS and compares
/// them with the root hashes stored in data availability header.
